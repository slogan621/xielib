TIFF Software "Release" 3.30 (changes since 3.2beta)
----------------------------------------------------
General changes:
    o the application interfaces have been overhauled to promote portability;
      a new set of typedefs are defined in tiff.h and tiffio.h and used in
      the library interfaces; see intro(3T) and libtiff/README for detailed
      information

Changes in libtiff:
    o the internal types used by the library have been reworked for portability
      to 64-bit architectures (as well as 16-bit machines)
    o the library no longer restricts the number of samples/pixel to <= 4
    o the ExtraSamples tag is now fully supported; uses of the old Matteing tag
      should eliminated
    o TIFFGetFieldDefaulted now correctly handles the TransferFunction,
      ReferenceBlackWhite, and ExtraSamples, tags 
    o ExtraSamples tags incorrectly written with a BYTE type are now accepted
      for compatiblity with Adobe Photoshop v2.5 (the 6.0 spec requires SHORTs)
    o strip chopping is now done for appropriately structured tiled images
    o a minor memory leak in the directory writing logic was plugged
    o RATIONAL and SRATIONAL values are written with more care to avoid loss of
      precision
    o strip sizes and numbers are now long rather than int
    o strip decoding routines now increment the row number as they go so that
      diagnostic messages are more meaningful
    o the YCbCR to RGB conversion algorithms have been improved
    o a bug was fixed in the YCbCr to RGB conversion algorithm
    o TIFFPrintDirectory no longer displays the Matteing; instead showing the
      ExtraSamples information
    o TIFFSetWriteOffset is a new function that is useful for overwriting image
      data (added for overwriting retransmitted facsimile pages)
    o TIFFIsByteSwapped is a new function that can be used to decide whether or
      not to byteswap >8-bit data
    o Island Graphics-specific tags are defined in tiff.h (but no support is
      otherwise included)
    o the VMS support code handles bogus files written with fixed records
    o the Macintosh support code no longer tries to seek off the end of a file
    o the unused file machdep.h was removed

Changes in the tools:
    o all uses of bzero and bcmp have been replaced by the more common mem*
      requivalent functions
    o ppm2tiff.c has a new -resolution option to specify the image resolution
      in dot/inch
    o sgigt.c has an improved YCbCr to RGB conversion algorithm; it also does
      a better job of recognizing images that it cannot handle
    o sgisv.c now saves separated data correctly
    o tiff2ps.c has many changes: the -a option forces all images in a TIFF
      to be converted as PostScript (not EPS), the -h and -w options are now
      interpreted as the width and height to use for the printed area, a new
      -2 option causes PostScript Level II to be generated
    o tiffcmp.c has been updated to handle ExtraSamples tags
    o tiffcp.c now handles tiled images (thanks to JT Conklin); new -tiledepth
      and -tilewidth options can be used to specify the dimensions of tiles in
      output image; -strips and -tiles options can be used to select a specific
      data organization for the resultant image; a new -1d option forces 1D
      encoding of the output image when using CCITT Group 3 encoding
    o a bug in the handling of packed SHORT and BYTE tag values was fixed
      (again) in tiffdump.c

Changes in the contrib software:
    o the fax2ps program is now more robust in decoding images with
      errors in the encoded data
