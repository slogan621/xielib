.SH NAME
rgb2ycbcr \- convert non-YCbCr
.SM TIFF
images to a YCbCr
.SM TIFF
image

[
.B \-c
.I compression
] [
.B \-h

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rgb2ycbcr
converts
.SM RGB
color, grayscale, or bilevel
.SM TIFF
images to YCbCr images by
transforming and sampling pixel data.
If multiple files are specified on the command line,
.I rgb2ycbcr
converts all but the last file, writing a
separate directory for each source
in the destination file.
.PP
By default, chrominance samples are created by sampling
2 by 2 blocks of luminance values.
The
.B \-h
and
.B \-v
options can be used to specify alternate horizontal
and vertical sampling dimensions, respectively.
Note that only 1, 2, and 4 should be used for portability.
.PP
By default, output data are compressed with the
.SM LZW
compression scheme.
A different scheme can be selected with the
.B \-c
option; one of:
.I none
(for no compression),
.I packbits
(for PackBits compression),
and
.I lzw
(for
.SM LZW
compression).
.PP
By default, output data are compressed in strips with
the number of rows in each strip selected so that the
size of a strip is never more than 8 kilobytes.
The
.B \-r
option can be used to explicitly set the number of
rows per strip.
