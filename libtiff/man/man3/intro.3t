.SH NAME
intro \- introduction to
.IR libtiff ,
a library for reading and writing
.SM TIFF
files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <tiffio.h>"
.br
cc file.c
.B -ltiff
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Libtiff
is a library for reading and writing data files encoded with the
.I "Tag Image File"
format, Revision 6.0 (or revision 5.0 or revision 4.0).
This file format is suitable for archiving multi-color and
monochromatic image data.
.PP
The library supports several compression algorithms, as indicated
by the
.I Compression
field, including:
no compression (1),
.SM CCITT
1D Huffman compression (2),
.SM CCITT
Group 3 Facsimile compression (3),
.SM CCITT
Group 4 Facsimile compression (4),
Lempel-Ziv & Welch compression (5),
word-aligned 1D Huffman compression (32771), and
PackBits compression (32773).
In addition, several nonstandard compression algorithms are supported:
the 4-bit compression algorithm used
by the
.I ThunderScan
program (32809) (decompression only),
and NeXT's 2-bit compression algorithm (32766) (decompression only).
Directory information may be in either little- or big-endian byte
order\-byte swapping is automatically done by the library.
Data bit ordering may be either Most Significant Bit (\c
.SM MSB\c
) to Least Significant Bit (\c
.SM LSB\c
) or
.SM LSB
to
.SM MSB.
Finally, the library does not support files in which the
.IR BitsPerSample ,
.IR Compression ,
.IR MinSampleValue ,
or
.IR MaxSampleValue
fields are defined differently on a per-sample basis
(in Rev. 6.0 the
.I Compression
tag is not defined on a per-sample basis, so this is immaterial).
.SH "DATA TYPES"
The library makes extensive use of C typedefs to promote portability.
Two sets of typedefs are used, one for communication with clients
of the library and one for internal data structures and parsing of the
.SM TIFF
format.
The following typedefs are exposed to users either through
function definitions or through parameters passed through the
varargs interfaces.
.in +.5i
.sp 5p
.ta +\w'typedef unsigned <thing> uint32;    'u
.nf
typedef unsigned short uint16;	16-bit unsigned integer
typedef unsigned <thing> uint32;	32-bit unsigned integer
.sp 5p
typedef unsigned int ttag_t;	directory tag
typedef uint16 tdir_t;	directory index
typedef uint16 tsample_t;	sample number
typedef uint32 tstrip_t;	strip number
typedef uint32 ttile_t;	tile number
typedef int32 tsize_t;	i/o size in bytes
typedef void* tdata_t;	image data ref
typedef void* thandle_t;	client data handle
typedef int32 toff_t;	file offset
.fi
.sp 5p
.in -.5i
Note that
.IR tstrip_t ,
.IR ttile_t ,
and
.I tsize_t
are constrained to be no more than 32-bit quantities by
32-bit fields they are stored in in the
.SM TIFF
image.
Likewise
.I tsample_t
is limited by the 16-bit field used to store the
.I SamplesPerPixel
tag.
.I tdir_t
constrains the maximum number of
.SM IFDs
that may appear in an image and may be an arbitrary size (w/o penalty). 
.I ttag_t
must be either int, unsigned int, pointer, or double because
the library uses a varargs interface and
.SM "ANSI C"
restricts the type of the parameter before an ellipsis to be a
promoted type.
.I toff_t
is defined as int32 because TIFF file offsets are (unsigned) 32-bit
quantities.
A signed value is used because some interfaces return \-1 on error.
Finally, note that user-specified data references are
passed as opaque handles and only cast at the lowest layers where
their type is presumed.
.SH "LIST OF ROUTINES"
The following routines are available.
Consult specific manual pages for details on their operation.
(The manual page names give here are for systems
where the full function names can not be encoded in the filesystem;
on most systems doing ``man function-name'' will work.)

.SH "TAG USAGE"
The table below lists the
.SM TIFF
tags that are recognized and handled by the library.
If no use is indicated in the table, then the library
reads and writes the tag, but does not use it internally.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All error messages are directed through the
.IR TIFFError
routine.
By default messages are directed to
.B stderr
in the form:
.IR "module: message\en."
Warning messages are likewise directed through the
.IR TIFFWarning
routine.

.SH BUGS
The library does not support multi-sample images
where some samples have different bits/sample.
.PP
It is not possible to overwrite the contents of a strip with
.IR TIFFWriteEncodedStrip
or
.IR TIFFWriteRawStrip
since they
.I append
to a strip.
Likewise,
.IR TIFFWriteEncodedTile
and
.IR TIFFWriteRawTile
append to a tile.
.PP
The library does not support random access to compressed data
that is organized with more than one row per tile or strip.
The library discards unknown tags.
The library should do more validity checking of a directory's contents.
