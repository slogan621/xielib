.SH NAME
TIFFScanlineSize, TIFFStripSize, TIFFTileSize \- return the size (in bytes) of a scanline, strip, or tile for an open
.SM TIFF
file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B "#include <tiffio.h>"
.B "tsize_t TIFFScanlineSize(TIFF* tif)"
.B "tsize_t TIFFStripSize(TIFF* tif)"
.B "tsize_t TIFFVStripSize(TIFF* tif, uint32 nrows)"
.B "tsize_t TIFFTileSize(TIFF* tif)"
.B "tsize_t TIFFVTileSize(TIFF* tif, uint32 nrows)"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR TIFFScanlineSize
returns the size in bytes of a row of data as it would be
returned in a call to
.IR TIFFReadScanline ,
or as it would be expected in a call to
.IR TIFFWriteScanline .
.PP
.IR TIFFStripSize
returns the equivalent size for a strip of data as it would
be returned in a call to
.IR TIFFReadEncodedStrip
or as it would be expected in a call to
.IR TIFFWriteEncodedStrip .
.PP
.IR TIFFTileSize
returns the equivalent size for a tile of data as it would
be returned in a call to
.IR TIFFReadTile
or as it would be expected in a call to
.IR TIFFWriteTile .
.PP
.IR TIFFVStripSize
returns the number of bytes in a strip with
.I nrows
rows of data.
Likewise,
.IR TIFFVTileSize
returns the number of bytes in a row-aligned tile with
.I nrows
of data.
.PP
These sizes are typically used when dynamically allocating
I/O buffers.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
None.
