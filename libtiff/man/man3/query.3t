.SH DESCRIPTION
The following routines return status information about an open
.SM TIFF
file.
.PP
.IR TIFFCurrentDirectory
returns the index of the current directory (directories
are numbered starting at 0).
This number is suitable for use with the
.IR TIFFSetDirectory
routine.
.PP
.IR TIFFCurrentRow ,
.IR TIFFCurrentStrip ,
and
.IR TIFFCurrentTile ,
return the current row, strip, and tile, respectively,
that is being read or written.
These values are updated each time a read or write is done.
.PP
.IR TIFFFileno
returns the underlying file descriptor used to access the 
.SM TIFF
image in the filesystem.
.PP
.IR TIFFFileName
returns the pathname argument passed to
.IR TIFFOpen
or
.IR TIFFFdOpen .
.PP
.IR TIFFGetMode
returns the mode with which the underlying file was opened.
On
.SM UNIX
systems, this is the value passed to the
.IR open (2)
system call.
.PP
.IR TIFFIsTiled
returns a non-zero value if the image data has
a tiled organization.
Zero is returned if the image data is organized in strips.
.PP
.IR TIFFIsByteSwapped
returns a non-zero value if the image data was in a different
byte-order than the host machine.
Zero is returned if the image data and local host byte-orders
are the same.
Data samples that are more than 8 bits wide must be byte-swapped
by the application.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
None.

.IR TIFFOpen (3T),
.IR TIFFFdOpen (3T)
